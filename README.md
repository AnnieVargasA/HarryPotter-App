### Questions

- What do you liked the most during your development?
  I liked the CSS part i really love the colors and forms from the design, also since i have some experience with design it's really placeant to accomplish it

- If you had gotten more time What would you improve or add?
  I'd add a persist favorites list using local storage also currently there's some info missing when adding a new character so definitely i'd add those information also i'd add more filters like by house and maybe some kind of sort by name

- Tell us about some bug you encountered and how you solved it?
  When you use the JSON database you need a id to store it using json-server so i use Date.now() as a id generator to fix that issue also if you currently add a repeated character it would render into the screen
